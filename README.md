# RayTracer

### Description 
A fully functional ray tracer written in C++, using OpenGL and the Tucano Framework. Built for the final project of the course Computer Graphics (CSE2210)

### First implementation goals
- Perform ray intersections with planes, triangles, and bounding boxes.
- Computate shading at the  rst impact point (di use and specular).
- Perform recursive raytracing for re ections to simulate specular materials.
- Calculate hard shadows from a point light.
- Calculate soft shadows from a spherical light centered at a point light.
- Show an interactive display inOpenGLof the 3D scene and a debug raytracer. A ray from a chosen pixel should be shown viaOpenGL, illustratingthe interactions with the surfaces.
- Implement a (simple) acceleration structure.
- Show a scene created by the group, exported as a wavefront object (OBJ)and directly loaded into the application
