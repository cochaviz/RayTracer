# RayTracer

### Description 
A fully functional ray tracer written in C++, using OpenGL and the Tucano Framework. Built for the final project of the course Computer Graphics (CSE2210)

### Project How-To
- Always build into a folder called 'build', this to make sure that nobody uploads the entire binary.
- Never work directly in the master branch.
- Keep the cards in the 'Project' page up to date, and make sure you include your name in the cards that you're involved with. This way we can keep each other in check and know exactly what to ask to whom. 

### First implementation goals
There have been some changes to our minimum implementation goals. The minimal requirements are now our way to a sufficient mark
everything else in the firt implementation goals is extra!

#### Minimal requirements
- [x] Perform ray intersections with planes, triangles, and bounding boxes.
- [ ] Computate shading at the first impact point (diffuse and specular).
- [ ] Calculate hard shadows from a point light.
- [ ] Implement a (simple) acceleration structure.
- [ ] Show a scene created by the group, exported as a wavefront object (OBJ)and directly loaded into the application.

#### Extra implementation goals
- [ ] Perform recursive raytracing for reflections to simulate specular materials.
- [ ] Calculate soft shadows from a spherical light centered at a point light.
- [ ] Show an interactive display inOpenGLof the 3D scene and a debug raytracer. A ray from a chosen pixel should be shown via OpenGL, illustrating the interactions with the surfaces.

These requirements are also made into cards in the github 'Project' page. Please keep that page up to date so that we all know how far we are with the whole project!
